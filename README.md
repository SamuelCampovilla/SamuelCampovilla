# About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student at **PUC-Campinas**, finishing my first year with strong interests in **back-end development**, **software architecture**, and **application security**.
I enjoy solving complex technical problems, understanding systems at a deeper level, and building clean, maintainable solutions.

My profile combines three strengths:

- **Strong logic & low-level proficiency** (C is my strongest language)
- **Curiosity for security and safe software design**
- **A natural inclination toward technical leadership and big-picture thinking**
